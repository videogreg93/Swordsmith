	You will receive your orders at the top of the screen. There are three weapons (Sword, Shield, Katana) and each can either be in Copper, Iron, or Gold. To make a weapon, first pick up the correct case at the top of the screen, then bring it back to the correct forge at the bottom of the screen. If it's a sword or a shield, your weapon is done and can be brought to the front of the counter. If it's a katana however, you must then bring it to the anvil and mash 'z' to fold it.
